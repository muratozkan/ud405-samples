/**
 * Let's do the minimal text example! Note that we use a SpriteBatch to draw, instead of a
 * ShapeRenderer.
 *
 * One more concept we haven't yet covered is filtering. That's how we determine what to do when we
 * draw a bitmap at a larger size than it was intended. Our options are Linear, and Nearest. Nearest
 * is what you want for pixel art, where you want things to maintain their sharp individual pixels.
 * For everything else, you want the Linear filter, as that will smooth between adjacent pixels.
